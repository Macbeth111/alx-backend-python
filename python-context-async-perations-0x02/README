# Python Context Managers and Async Operations

This project explores context managers and asynchronous programming in Python.

## Tasks:
1. **DatabaseConnection**: Class-based context manager using `__enter__` and `__exit__`.
2. **ExecuteQuery**: Reusable context manager for parameterized SQL queries.
3. **Async Queries**: Concurrently fetch users using `asyncio.gather()` and `aiosqlite`.
